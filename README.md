Zulu alarm clock
The problem can be solved using a list of queues (sublists) where each node is a watch or an alarm, and among them has a node hour, minute and second, making comparisons one alarm clock, find the minimum in each one and add difference to a count.

Stranger order
This problem can be solved with arrays, storing the number of predecessors numbers is written which, in turn, with the lowest common divisor method store the data in a new arrangement to display them on screen.

Dual Issues
with the implementan arrays, this problem can be solved with methods that are prime numbers and find its multiplicity more high among them, to Streamline the process, a method of sorting would facilitate the solution, if there is only a number prime is multiplied if same.

Decreasing max partitioning
a simple solution is, be comparing a single array in itself, without ordering methods, look to position if such arrangement, form a descending chain with the same elements, and if so, how many can get to form.

Micro_House
with the implementation of lists, you can solve this problem, where each node has a number, and an index and insert in its respective list to find the number with more luck, converting the numbers to bits, by the use of the XOR gate.

Army Parade:
The program is to look for all the possibilities of sending the military to the specified work,
The process that is performed is given a matrix of n * M will start with a sub matrix of 2 x 2 to find how many officers
There is in that division, that will be the amount of possibilities to send soldiers for that sub-matrix, ie:
The 1 are officers, the 0 are soldiers.

Zulu and Games 
With the use of lists, where there are two nodes, one with lower value and another with higher value, find the highest number between two nodes that do not intersect with each other, making values comparing between lists and adding a final counter to make a combo Magic, can solve this problem.
